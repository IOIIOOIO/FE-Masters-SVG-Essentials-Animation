## Introduction
As recommended in the course, most of the exercises are done in CodePen. We'll use a variety of frameworks throughout the course so using CodePen saves time on setups.

I'm already well-versed in SVG so at first I'm skipping most of the course to the GSAP and D3 sections. I have some experience with GSAP, having done some of ihatetomatoes courses. However, that was a long time ago, so I need a refresher and possibly some updated info.

I'll return to complete the rest of the course in future, because FrontEnd Masters now offers certificates of completion - which is always nice to have.

Below are the links to the exercises I worked on.
